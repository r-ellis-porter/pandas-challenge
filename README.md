# pandas-challenge

This Python script was written by me based on the material we covered in class.

PyCitySchools' script analyses a school districts' standardized testing scores given a .csv dataset with school information and a .csv dataset with students' information. This script merges the datasets and creates a district summary dataframe and school summary dataframe. It calculates, creates, and sorts a dataframe with relevant information about the five highest scoring schools and another dataframe with the five lowest scoring schools. It calculates and creates dataframes comparing scores by grade, by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type.
