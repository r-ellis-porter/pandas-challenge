# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to the PyCity Schools Analysis repository! As the Chief Data Scientist for the fictional PyCity's school district, I was tasked with analyzing district-wide standardized test results to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to aggregate the data provided, analyze key metrics, and identify trends in school performance across the district. By examining various factors such as school budgets, student scores, and school sizes, we aim to provide insights that will assist decision-makers in allocating resources effectively and prioritizing areas for improvement.

## Important Findings

### District Summary
- The PyCity school district comprises 15 schools with a total of 39,170 students.
- The district has a combined budget of $24.6 million.
- On average, students in the district scored 79 in math and 82 in reading.
- 75% of students passed math, 86% passed reading, and 65% passed both subjects.

### School Summary
- Charter schools generally outperform district schools in terms of student performance.
- The top-performing schools, such as Cabrera High School and Thomas High School, are charter schools with smaller student populations.
- Schools with lower budgets per student tend to have higher average scores and passing rates.

### Math and Reading Scores by Grade
- There are notable variations in average math and reading scores between schools, with some schools consistently performing better across all grades.

### Scores by School Spending
- Schools with lower budgets per student demonstrate higher average scores and passing rates compared to those with higher budgets per student.
- A linear, negative relationship exists between spending per student and standardized test results.

### Scores by School Size
- Small to medium-sized schools tend to outperform larger schools in both math and reading.
- Schools with fewer than 2000 students have significantly higher passing rates compared to larger schools.

### Scores by School Type
- Charter schools have higher average scores and passing rates than district schools.
- Students at charter schools, on average, perform better in both math and reading compared to their counterparts in district schools.

## Summary
This analysis provides valuable insights into school performance metrics within the PyCity school district. By examining factors such as budget allocation, school size, and school type, decision-makers can better understand areas of strength and areas for improvement. These findings can inform strategic decisions regarding resource allocation, curriculum development, and educational policies aimed at enhancing student outcomes across the district.
